MDK-1/4/19 - Initial entry

W4Sight is engaging me to extract data from an existing SF system for loading into a new system owned by an NP that is taking the old NP over.  It involves understanding the data structure of the new system, and then creating a procedure for progressively uploading the old records into the system so that the related records correctly import into the system properly.

Ideally, preserving the original create dates will be necessary.  Initial kick-off meeting will be 1/10/19 at 7AM.
