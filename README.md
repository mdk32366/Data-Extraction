## Data-Extraction

MDK-1/4/19 - Initial entry

W4Sight is engaging me to extract data from an existing SF system for loading into a new system owned by an NP that is taking the old NP over.  It involves understanding the data structure of the new system, and then creating a procedure for progressively uploading the old records into the system so that the related records correctly import into the system properly.

Ideally, preserving the original create dates will be necessary.  Initial kick-off meeting will be 1/10/19 at 7AM.

MDK - 1/8/19:  Destination is Little Green Light.    Two ways to do it, multiple spreadsheets, or one spreadsheet with all relationships linked and defined.  Not sure how to play it until I see the data.

Agenda for the kickoff meeting, and what I need to prepare:

- [ ] DVLC project stuff - Ashley at the Client let me know that she's requested Sharepoint credentials for you, so please be on the lookout for those.


- [ ] Get any clarification needed about what records should be pulled from Salesforce so that we can recreate all the key pieces of info they are looking for (see the table in the scope document).  

- [ ] But we don't want to pull junk they don't need, so can you be prepared to ask about what criteria you should use to select Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, etc?  

- [ ] Anything else you and I should discuss beforehand?

MDK - 1/9/19:  Let Deb know the creds from Ashley didn't come through yet, and that I did some prelim work on report outputs.

MDK - 1/10/19:  Kickoff meeting went well.  Rachel is my contact at client.  She's also exec director.  Chances are she'll want us to make it stepwise, or just do it for her.  Deb has been great.  This is their fourth or fifth port from SF to LGL.  I know have access to LGL so I can start getting some experience with the platform.

Merger happens effective June 1.  Data go live April 1.  

Spouse Records: Need to be handled differently.

Granted Access to clients LGL and ran a dupe check - Nothing!  This is good.

A couple of key notes:

Affiliations and Soft Credits:  Need to gauge the extent to which they are used, and then determine IF or WHEN they'd come over.
Opportunity Roles: Did they use them?  If so, there are implications to be ameliorated.
